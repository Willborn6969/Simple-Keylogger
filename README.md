# Simple-Keylogger
Developed keylogger to record keystrokes and save to file.
This tool evaluates password strength based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, providing real-time feedback to users by categorizing their passwords as "Very Weak," "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong." This project emphasizes the importance of robust password practices in digital security and merges cybersecurity knowledge with practical coding skills.
